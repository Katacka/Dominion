                        How to play DOMINION
    Goal:
        Have the most point in your deck when the game ends.

    Types of cards
        Action Cards
            Each does something different like give you more buys, actions or cards
            Read each description
            Cost an action
        Treasure
            Basically money comes in 3 levels: copper, silver, and gold
            don’t cost an action to play
        Victory Cards
            Give you points, don’t cost an action to play

    Starting the game
    Your starting deck has 10 cards, 3 estates and 7 copper
    You may play with 2-4 players.
    The smart AI works. It will probably beat you.
    If you see the opponent hand going up and down and the actions, buys and treasures numbers going up, the AI is going to win. It will stop when the buys  get to about 48. You have lost. This is not a bug.

    Playing the game
    At the start of your turn you will have 1 action, 1 buy and 0 treasure
    Playing action cards decreases your actions
    Buying cards decreases your buys
    Playing treasure increases your treasure
    During your turn you may:
    Play a card in your hand by clicking on it
    Buy a card
    Play enough treasure to cover the cost (in the corner in a yellow circle)
    Click on a card in the shop to buy it
    Note: Cards are greyed out when all of them have been bought
    View a card description by long pressing the card
    Ending your turn
    Click the end turn button
    The game will not automatically end your turn
    You may end your turn even if there are still moves you can make
    If you have no actions and (no treasure or no buys), you must end your turn

    Ending the game
    The game ends when either:
    All the provinces are bought
    Any 3 shop piles are empty
    Winning
    the player with the most victory points wins
